If you ever work on a remote servers network settings then this script may safe you from having to call support, and waiting on them.

When started/executed it

 * Sleeps first for 1 hour
 * Then it renames the ”/etc/network/interfaces” file by adding the current time stamp to the end of the file
 * It renames a file called ”/etc/network/interfaces.org” to ”/etc/network/interfaces”
 * And finally it restarts the server.

It also warns you a couple minutes before it does all that so you can terminate the program. Of course if you have been locked out you can't terminate it, and it will execute. *Giving you a fresh start!*


To start

	network_Safety_Restart.sh start &

To Stop

	network_Safety_Restart.sh stop
