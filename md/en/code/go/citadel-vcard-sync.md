#### Features

 - Citadel Sync will work on most operating systems including Linux, Mac, PC, Android ...
 - Converts a multi vCard file in to many for each to hold a single contact
 - Adds UID and REV fields to the vCard if missing
 - Uploads vCards to a given remote [Citadel] Mail Server
 - You can specify, which folder on the server to upload to 
 - Can populate the Display name field from first and last name, or populate first and last name from display name
  

#### Features planned

 - Compare revision state and sync in case you modify a vCard on the server. This 
 is not supported in version 1, vCards on the server will be over written by the local once.
 - Create an executable for Android etc.
 - Create a single vCard to hold all contacts, so it can be used as an address book in Thunderbird etc.

#### Features not supported

 - Does not support non standard vCard fields like:
   *(If you must have one or two of those let me know)*
 	- X-EVOLUTION-RADIO
 	- X-KADDRESSBOOK-X-AssistantsName


#### Hints: 
 - Backup your vCards before you start using citadelsync, both local and server
 - Backup your config file before you upgrade to a new version of citadelsync

A config file is required, set it with the -c flag.

Username and Password for the [Citadel] Mail Server may be
defined in the config file, or optionally on the command line
